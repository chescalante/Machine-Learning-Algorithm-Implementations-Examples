Installing OpenCV
1. In the Anaconda Prompt:
>> conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
2. Check if appears in the list of packages:
>> conda list
3. I was not able to make it work unless the Haar classifier was in the same directory. Bear this in mind

I keep an image in case you like to test other features on OpenCV
